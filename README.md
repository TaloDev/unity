## Docs

You can find installation instructions and API guides in [our docs](https://docs.trytalo.com/docs/unity/install).

## Project structure

The repo itself is a Unity game (the Talo Playground) that lets you try out and preview functionality from a UI. Within that, Talo is installed as a local package.
