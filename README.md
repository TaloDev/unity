# Talo Unity Package: self-hostable game dev tools

Talo is a collection of tools and APIs designed to make game development easier and to help you make better data-driven decisions.

From essentials like player management, stats and leaderboards to advanced APIs for game saves, event tracking and player authentication.

The Talo Unity Package is a lightweight wrapper around the [REST API](https://docs.trytalo.com/docs/http/authentication). It also includes handy utilities and a collection of ready-to-use samples.

This repo is a Unity game (the Talo Playground) that lets you try out and preview functionality from a UI. Within that, Talo is installed as a local package.
